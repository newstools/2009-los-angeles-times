Here is a poem FrancEyE wrote in 2004 after the abrupt death of her 46-year-old daughter, Skye. COUNTING When I was 35, my husband said “Well, Fran, you’re half-way there.” What could he have meant? But though we didn’t subscribe to the bible what he meant was 3 score and 10 are the years we expect.  He lived 6 extra and I’ve lived 12 so far so we owe this daughter dead at 46 (or I owe her since he can no longer pay) 6. I owe her 6. I may die still in debt. She wants me to go on. I’ll try, but living this way, living with her gone, is not quite living. I can grieve, though, grieve, for as long as she wants. PARTICULATE MATTER Even at noon, so empty and blue the sky, an ocean of air to walk in, breathe, and rejoice, at its fringes over the mountains, over the bay, paled to gray-white. I’d look away, not wanting to remember that baby nearly 40 years ago, a beautiful gift from the blue with the sky in her eyes looking back at me when other mothers said they were moving out of L.A., moving right away, because their doctors told them staying here would shorten their babies’ lives. I didn’t move away. She did move finally off to the whole world’s breast-cancer capital. Who knows if her life will be shorter? I think of it though whenever I hear her cough, and of course as the other mothers moved their babies away, the smog moved too; it didn’t leave, it just spread over land and sea so wherever they are, the air there now is what it was here, then. And here I am. I’m glad I didn’t come here to breathe or to lengthen my children’s lives delightful though those pleasures are; I came here to use my voice, to sing, to get it all down, and I’m doing it the best I can and now as the sun’s going down and that gray-white’s turned to brown and the great cerulean dome has darkened to dinge, I’m still walking, and I still rejoice.
